### Hey there! 👋

I'm **Ahmet Burak**,

I design and build software, always aiming to understand how things work under the hood.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll try to engineer it or figure out how to break it (and then fix it).

My main tech stack is **C++, C#, Rust,** and **JavaScript (Node.js)**.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but most of my work has been private until now. I've built dozens of tools and systems privately, and now I'm working on moving them to public repos.
